# VULCAN: Visualization Utility for Luminous Cluster Analysis in NIR/MIR
## *A Streamlit web application to explore IFU spectra in the Infrared*

## Project Overview

This project's goal is to allow any user to upload and explore basic analyses' of IFU spectra of a Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG). It starts by showing a dataset from JWST's MIRI MRS of Abell 2597 and the features that can be applied / how they can be applied to the user's own dataset. As of now, Vulcan is not ready to handle uploaded datasets. 

The A2597 dataset was chosen because it is a well studied cluster galaxy, and currently has public JWST data out on it. This was used to design and write the code for Vulcan in preparation for future JWST datasets.
